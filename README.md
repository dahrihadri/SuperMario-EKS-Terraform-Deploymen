![chrome_oOzsyPjd4Z](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d289a6ad-10d0-4fa9-9551-4062cf380917)

Who doesn't love **Super Mario**? It's a timeless game that takes us back to our childhood. In this project, we'll deploy the Super Mario game on **Amazon EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service)** using **Terraform**. We'll go through every step, from setting up the EC2 instance to running the game on Kubernetes!

Don't worry‚ÄîI'll explain the purpose of each step, so it's not just a set of instructions but a learning experience. Whether you're new to AWS or a seasoned DevOps professional, this guide will make sure you understand why we do things the way we do.

## Step 2: Setup Docker, Terraform, AWS CLI, and Kubectl üõ†Ô∏è

### **Install Docker**
Docker helps us containerize applications. It will play a crucial role in deploying Kubernetes resources.

```bash
apt install docker.io -y
usermod -aG docker $USER
newgrp docker
```

![chrome_KCqK8rLW8t](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/98300aaa-ca1c-45f9-9143-84bdbec4d5a7)

### **Install Terraform**
Terraform is the backbone of this project, enabling us to define and deploy infrastructure as code.

```bash
sudo apt install wget -y
wget -O- https://apt.releases.hashicorp.com/gpg | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /usr/share/keyrings/hashicorp-archive-keyring.gpg
echo "deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/hashicorp-archive-keyring.gpg] https://apt.releases.hashicorp.com $(lsb_release -cs) main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/hashicorp.list
sudo apt update && sudo apt install terraform -y
```

### **Install AWS CLI**
AWS CLI allows you to interact with AWS resources via command-line, which is essential for managing EKS.

```bash
curl "https://awscli.amazonaws.com/awscli-exe-linux-x86_64.zip" -o "awscliv2.zip"
sudo apt-get install unzip -y
unzip awscliv2.zip
sudo ./aws/install
```

![chrome_ke5iAth3PV](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/05efac3b-c3bc-4006-a59b-2d72da36f633)

### **Install Kubectl**
Kubectl is the command-line tool to interact with Kubernetes clusters.

```bash
sudo apt install curl -y
curl -LO "https://dl.k8s.io/release/$(curl -L -s https://dl.k8s.io/release/stable.txt)/bin/linux/amd64/kubectl"
sudo install -o root -g root -m 0755 kubectl /usr/local/bin/kubectl
```

## Step 3: Create IAM Role for EC2 üîê

### **Why IAM Role?**
We need an IAM role to allow our EC2 instance to interact with AWS services (like EKS, S3, etc.) without hardcoding credentials.

1. **Open IAM** from the AWS console.
2. **Create a Role** with **EC2** as the trusted entity.
3. **Select Administrator Access** as the permission policy (for simplicity in this project).
4. **Give the role a name** and create it.

---

## Step 4: Attach IAM Role to EC2 üîó

1. Go to the **EC2 dashboard**.
2. Click on **Actions > Security > Modify IAM Role**.
3. Select the IAM role you created in Step 3 and attach it to your EC2 instance.

## Step 5: Building Infrastructure Using Terraform üõ†Ô∏è

Now that everything is set up, let's use Terraform to build the infrastructure.

### **Clone the Super Mario GitHub Repo**
```bash
mkdir super_mario
cd super_mario
git clone https://github.com/dahrihadri/SuperMario-EKS-Terraform-Deployment.git
cd SuperMario-EKS-Terraform-Deployment/EKS-TF
```

![chrome_xQbu3B64Sj](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/38a9046d-29d9-4a8f-acbd-73a0e18b14f2)


### **Edit `backend.tf`**
Make sure to provide your S3 bucket name and region in the `backend.tf` file. This allows Terraform to store the state file in S3.

### **Run Terraform Commands**

1. **Initialize Terraform**:
   ```bash
   terraform init
   ```
   This command sets up your working environment.

![chrome_OgRDsGMbzg](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/13977652-5f93-47a3-8040-addbdf4166fe)

2. **Validate the Configuration**:
   ```bash
   terraform validate
   ```
   This ensures there are no syntax errors in your Terraform files.

![chrome_qeitS98lz0](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/453f0e1b-b7c1-4fa1-8f00-71906d41b9a8)

3. **Plan the Infrastructure**:
   ```bash
   terraform plan
   ```
   Terraform will show you a blueprint of what resources will be created.

![chrome_IiV5QD2NrJ](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4fae7d0f-2840-4963-bdfb-16585e27f39d)


4. **Apply the Plan**:
   ```bash
   terraform apply --auto-approve
   ```
   This command creates the infrastructure automatically.

Below command is used to update the configuration of EKS

   ```bash
   aws eks update-kubeconfig --name EKS_CLOUD --region us-east-1
   ```
   
The command aws eks update-kubeconfig --name EKS_CLOUD --region us-east-1 is like telling our computer, "Hey, I'm using Amazon EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service) in the 'us-east-1' region, and I want to connect to it. you could use your desired location

---

## Step 6: Create Deployment and Service for EKS üéÆ

Now that EKS is up, let‚Äôs deploy the Super Mario game!

1. Change directory to where the deployment and service YAML files are stored:
   ```bash
   cd ..
   ```

2. **Create Deployment**:
   ```bash
   kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml
   ```

3. **Create Service**:
   ```bash
   kubectl apply -f service.yaml
   ```

4. **Get All Resources**:
   ```bash
   kubectl get all
   ```

5. **Get the Load Balancer Ingress**:
   ```bash
   kubectl describe service mario-service
   ```
   Copy the **Load Balancer Ingress** and paste it in your browser. The Super Mario game should now be running! üïπÔ∏è

---

## Step 7: Destroy the Infrastructure üßπ

Before you leave, remember to clean up to avoid unnecessary AWS charges!

1. **Delete the Service and Deployment**:
   ```bash
   kubectl delete service mario-service
   kubectl delete deployment mario-deployment
   ```

2. **Destroy the EKS Cluster**:
   ```bash
   cd EKS-TF
   terraform destroy --auto-approve
   ```

3. **Terminate the EC2 Instance**:
   Go to the EC2 dashboard and terminate your instance.
